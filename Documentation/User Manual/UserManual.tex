\section{General Information}
\subsection{Title Page}
Trii by Devs101
\subsection{System Overview}
A skill tree is a graphical representation of the players current skills they have unlocked, the skills they can unlock and the dependencies the skills have on one another. This allows user to create custom configuration of the character's skills. Trii allows users the ability to design complex and powerful skill trees with little to no effort. The skill tree that is designed can then be exported as a .js file or a json file to be used later on. If the user so wishes they can import a tree from a json file.
