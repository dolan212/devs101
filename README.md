Trii is a skill tree editor, where a user can create, customize, test, import and export
skill trees. A skill tree is a type of graph that represents certain, user defined, skills
that have or can be acquired. These skills can be anything from learning how to
walk or learning how to fly. A skill tree can be used for many purposes, such as
managing character skills in games, visually represent the collection of skills of the
employees of a company for management purposes or it can be used by anyone
that wants a visual way of keeping track of all the skills they have acquired.
